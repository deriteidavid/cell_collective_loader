## Cell Collective loader

This is a notebook that downloads all models uploaded to the [Cell Collective](https://research.cellcollective.org/) and creates local [SBML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBML)  and [BooleanNet](https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet) files. It also collects all molecular species in all models in a table (dataframe) with associated models, links, etc.

You will need the following packages:

* Colomoto Jupyter [https://github.com/colomoto/colomoto-jupyter]
* GINsim python [https://github.com/GINsim/GINsim-python]
* Pandas [https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html]
